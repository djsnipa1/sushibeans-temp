The idea of Sushi Beans is to get as many sushi beans as possible. This page shows the progression of the full game.

Part I: Beginning

In the beginning, the only button you can press is "Make sushi beans". This adds to
your sushi bean counter, allowing you to then buy some sushi beans per second. after
buying a few sushi beans per second, you can save up 500 sushi beans for the sushi
beans per second per second. While saving up for this, you discover that you can
prestige to gain a multiplier. 1 prestige point doesn't change anything, but
saving up 3 increases your multiplier to 2x. After doing the game again, but
twice as fast, you can gain 3 more prestige points and reach a 3x multiplier. Then
4x, then 5x, and so on...

Part II: Expansion

After getting around a 10x multiplier, you can get points in a matter of seconds.
Each prestige points adds 2 to your multiplier, then 3, then 4, and eventually
your multiplier is over 100x. After this point, it becomes best to click to
2000 sushi beans to get 2 points each time. Your multiplier goes into the
thousands, then into the millions, and you earn 5 or more points after just one
click. The fastest method at this point is simply to click once and then prestige,
as clicking anymore makes barely any difference. Your sushi beans reach e20, then
e40, then e100, and before too long...

part III: Singularity

You'll have recieved 1 singularity from collapsing, opening a new tab. At this point,
the only thing to buy is "Increase multiplier from (multiplier)^1 to (multiplier)^2".
This squares your multiplier, but unfortunately 1^2 is sill 1, meaning you have to
start again just as slow as before.
